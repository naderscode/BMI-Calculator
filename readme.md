The BMI (Body Mass Index) is often used to determine whether a person with a sedentary lifestyle is overweight or underweight for their height. A person's BMI is calculated with the following formula:
BMI=Weight*703/Height2
The purpose of this Java program is to ask the user to input a person's weight and height, then to calculate and display the person's BMI. 
Also, in the code I used some exception handling mechanisms to check for data input mismatch, and Arithmetic Exceptions.
